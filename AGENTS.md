# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.

## Dev skills, progress reports and the merge gate

Load the Mzizi **dev skills** before starting work: `mzizi_get_skills category=dev` on the Mzizi MCP (`mcp.mzizi.dev`), or `@nyuchi/mzizi-skills` from npm. They are `digital-hygiene` and `progress-report`.

- **Digital hygiene.** Check free disk before starting, clone only under `$TMPDIR`, share build caches, and audit, then delete, your clones once the work merges (`digital-hygiene` skill).
- **Clone isolation.** Clone only into a directory unique to you; never touch another agent's.
- **Progress reports.** All dev work runs on a 10-minute progress-report loop (`progress-report` skill): measured bars, what changed, and a final "Needs you:" line. Report ticks never publish, release, merge or deploy without the owner's approval.
- **Merge gate.** Merge only when the work is complete, CI is green, it's verified at runtime, and `/code-review` has run with findings resolved.
